# Project History

## April 5, 2024
- Examined the repository to understand its purpose
- Found that this is a basic Flutter project template
- The project name suggests it's intended to be an example for Flutter local notifications
- However, the flutter_local_notifications package is not yet included in the dependencies
- The main.dart file contains only the default Flutter counter app template

## April 6, 2024
- Added flutter_local_notifications package using `flutter pub add flutter_local_notifications`
- Fixed build issues by:
  1. Updated Android NDK version to 27.0.12077973 (required by the notifications package)
  2. Enabled Java 8 desugaring by adding `isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true` and the desugar dependency

Current status: The project has the flutter_local_notifications package installed with necessary Android configuration fixes. Ready to implement notification functionality.
