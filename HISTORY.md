# Project History

## April 5, 2024
- Examined the repository to understand its purpose
- Found that this is a basic Flutter project template
- The project name suggests it's intended to be an example for Flutter local notifications
- However, the flutter_local_notifications package is not yet included in the dependencies
- The main.dart file contains only the default Flutter counter app template

## April 6, 2024
- Added flutter_local_notifications package using `flutter pub add flutter_local_notifications`
- Fixed build issues by:
  1. Updated Android NDK version to 27.0.12077973 (required by the notifications package)
  2. Enabled Java 8 desugaring by adding `isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true` and the desugar dependency
  3. Updated desugar_jdk_libs from 2.0.4 to 2.1.4 as required by flutter_local_notifications

- Implemented local notifications functionality:
  1. Created `noti_service.dart` with a service class to handle notifications setup and display
  2. Created a simple `home_page.dart` with a button to trigger notifications
  3. Updated `main.dart` to initialize notifications when the app starts

- Configured iOS for notifications:
  1. Modified AppDelegate.swift to import flutter_local_notifications
  2. Added plugin registrant callback setup for notification actions
  3. Set up UNUserNotificationCenter delegate for handling notifications when the app is in foreground

Current status: The project has a working implementation of flutter_local_notifications for both Android and iOS. The app displays a simple UI with a button that sends a test notification when pressed.
